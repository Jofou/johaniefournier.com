It takes me a long time to convince myself to do this. I had a blog with Wordpress, but the work to post code/Rmardown document was nothing to motivate me to write on a regular basis.

So, I finally took the leap and completely remake my blog with blogdown. It was scary at first but I succeed and I am so proud of the result!

Don’t ask me how I did it, though. There is so much good resources out there. I think I just patch them all together and Voilà the result! 🎈
