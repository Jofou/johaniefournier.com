H2O is a powerful tools to have a general idea of the performance of different models. Unfortunately this resource is constantly updating which make this structure hard to maintain in a production setting.

So I mainly use it to know which model perform best with my data. This make me gain a considerable amount of time. From there I can work on the few best models a make solid code for production purpose.

Letâ€™s see if I can make a template of this H2O technologies that will resist the test of time (and constant update ðŸ˜†)!

## Get the data

Letâ€™s look at the data of *ChaudiÃ¨re-Appalaches*

``` r
board_prepared <- pins::board_folder(path_to_file, versioned = TRUE)

data <- board_prepared %>%
  pins::pin_read("TS_chaudiere_appalaches") %>%
  select(pct_mo, sable_tf, sable, argile, limon, geometry) %>%
  sf::st_as_sf(.) %>%
  sf::st_centroid() %>%
  mutate(
    longitude = sf::st_coordinates(.)[, 1],
    latitude = sf::st_coordinates(.)[, 2]
  ) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  select(-geometry) %>%
  mutate_all(as.numeric) %>%
  drop_na()
```

## Explore the data

-   Organic Matter distribution

``` r
data %>%
  select(pct_mo) %>%
  my_num_dist()
```

<img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="2400" />

``` r
data <- data %>%
  filter(pct_mo > 0 & pct_mo < 10)
```

``` r
data %>%
  select(pct_mo) %>%
  my_num_dist()
```

**Letâ€™s see how everything is correlated**

``` r
data %>%
  my_corr_num_graph(data)
```

<img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="2400" />

    ## NULL

## Build the model

``` r
# Parallele Processing
doFuture::registerDoFuture()
n_cores <- parallel::detectCores()
future::plan(
  strategy = future::cluster,
  workers  = parallel::makeCluster(n_cores)
)
```

**Recipe**

``` r
# Define recipe
recipe_spec <- recipe(as.formula(pct_mo ~ .), data = data) %>%
  step_normalize(all_predictors())

tbl_prep <- recipe_spec %>%
  prep() %>%
  juice()

head(tbl_prep)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 Ã— 7

**CorrelationFunnel**

``` r
var_select <- tbl_prep %>%
  select(pct_mo) %>%
  correlationfunnel::binarize() %>%
  select(starts_with("pct_mo") & ends_with("_Inf")) %>%
  names()

tbl_prep %>%
  correlationfunnel::binarize() %>%
  correlationfunnel::correlate(var_select) %>%
  correlationfunnel::plot_correlation_funnel() +
  labs(title = "IRDA pct_mo - Correlation Funnel")
```
