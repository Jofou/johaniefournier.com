  I’m Johanie, a data analyst with over 15 years of experience, specializing in geospatial data analysis, visualization, and modelling. My passion lies in transforming complex spatial data into clear, actionable insights using R. Throughout my career, I’ve worked across various industries, helping businesses and researchers unlock the full potential of their data. Today, I focus on providing cutting-edge solutions in spatio-temporal data analysis, making advanced techniques accessible to learners and professionals.
  
  I studied agronomy, finished my M.Sc. in 2012. I worked in industry mostly doing research and helping farmers with their environmental obligations. I rediscovered R (had a brief introduction at school) in 2018 and never looked back.
