  Hi, my name is Johanie Fournier. Nice to meet you.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
  I am an aspiring business scientist. I work at Logiag, a consulting firm whose mission is to support the implementation of sustainable farming practices. My focus is to find insight from farming data to facilitate the work of agronomists in their advising of good management practices to farmers. I love making beautiful charts/maps, the statistical programming language R, my Australian shepherd dog, my beautiful garden, and black tea.
